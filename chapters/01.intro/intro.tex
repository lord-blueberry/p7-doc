\section{Interferometry and the Inverse Problem}\label{intro}
Radio Antennas in Astronomy require a sub-arcsecond angular resolution. For a single dish antenna, the angular resolution is $ \theta \approx \lambda / D$ radians, which leads to impossibly large diameters for radio wavelengths. Interferometers, where several dishes act as a single instrument, can achieve a high angular resolution for an economical price.  (Radio Astronomy has a lot of interest in Interferometers, building VLA, ALMA, LOFAR and planning SKA). However Interferometers do not observe the sky directly. Each antenna pair measures a Fourier component of the observed image. Furthermore the Fourier space is not fully samnpled, it is incomplete. The task is to reconstruct an image in Pixel space from an incomplete set of Fourier measurements (Visibilities). From here on forward term Visibility is used. It is interchangeable with Fourier Component.

Each antenna pair, quadratic number of data points with the number of antennas: a lot of data)(An interferometer does not observe the image directly. Simplified, each antenna pair observes a Fourier component of the An Antenna Pair measures a fourier component of the image.) (If all the fourier components are measured, the observed image could be retrieved by calculating the inverse fourier transform. However, only a limited set of visibilites can be measured.)(Inverting the problem results in an image with artefacts (Dirty Image).) (Clean can solve it for the current class of interferometers)

(Future Interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array do introduce additional problems in the inverse Problem.)(Modelling the new effects)(while being able to handle the large amount of data.)

\subsection{Simplified Inverse Problem}
For the current class of interferometers, retrieving the observed image of the sky is calculating the Inverse Fourier Transform of the measured Visibilities. (This is a simplification of the actual problem, which does not hold true for future instruments like SKA. How the Inverse Problem changes for future instruments is handled in section \ref{radio}). Since the Visibility Space is undersampled, the resulting image is 'dirty', as it contains effects from the instrument. The effects of the instrument can be modelled as a Point Spread Function (PSF). The Dirty Image is the Result of the True Image convolved with the PSF. Figure \ref{intro:inverse_problem} shows an example of the PSF, Dirty Image and True Image.

\end{figure}

The Dirty Image is the result of the Inverse Fourier Transform, the PSF on the other hand follows directly from the antenna configuration. Figure \ref{intro:ANT_UV_PSF} shows an example of the VLA instrument.

Each antenna pair samples a point in the UV Space. The distance between the antenna pair is called the baseline. Shorter baselines sample UV-Points closer to the center, while longer baselines sample points further away.  Each point in the UV Space represents a frequency Visibilities of the observed image: High frequency components are located away from the center and low frequency components are towards the center. Since each antenna pair contributes a Visibility, an Interferometer of $N$ antennas measures $(N-1)/2$ Visibilities. The configuration of the antenna sets up which points are sampled in the UV Space. The PSF can be calculated by using the Inverse Fourier Transform on the UV-Space.

Since the Dirty Image and the PSF are known, one needs to deconvolve the Dirty Image with the PSF and try to retrieve the True Image. More formally, it tries to find $X$ from the equation \eqref{intro:eq:deconvolve}. Since the environment is undersampled there are potentially multiple solutions. Furthermore the whole measurement is susceptible to noise, even if there is a unique solution for $X$, it may not be the true image. 

\begin{equation}\label{intro:eq:deconvolve}
X \star PSF = D_{Dirty} 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Deconvolution with CLEAN}
The CLEAN class of Algorithms\cite{hogbom1974aperture}\cite{schwab1984relaxing}\cite{rich2008multi}\cite{rau2011multi} are widely used in Radio Astronomy to tackle the Inverse Problem. 

It searches the highest peak in the Dirty Image and subtracts the PSF at that point. It then continues with the second highest peak until a number of iterations or the a threshold. Formalizing this, it greedily minimizes the optimization function \eqref{intro:eq:clean}. Each iteration it tries to searches which pixel reduces the objective function the most.

\begin{equation}\label{intro:eq:clean}
\underset{X}{minimize} \: \left \| D_{Dirty} - X \star PSF \right \|_2^2
\end{equation}

It is easy to see that if the objective is minimized to zero, then the $X$ of the optimization formula is a solution for our original deconvolution problem \eqref{intro:eq:deconvolve}. However, CLEAN stops before the global optimum is reached.


Clean follows from the simplified Inverse problem. The dirty image results from the True image getting convolved with the PSF. It searches to deconvolve the dirty image with the PSF and retrieve the actual sky image.

Clean implementation, removing the biggest peak. Early stopping


\subsection{From CLEAN to Compressed Sensing}


\begin{equation}\label{intro:eq:clean}
\underset{X}{minimize} \: \left \| D_{Dirty} - X \star PSF \right \|_2^2 + \lambda \left \| p(X) \right \|_1
\end{equation}




(Clean Approximates the solution)(Theoretical guarantees)

clean in CS formulation. Prior knowledge of the sky. Theory of compressed sensing states that we can retrieve the true image potentially below the Nyquist Shannon Rate.

Another way of looking at the inverse problem is to formulate it as the solution to an underdetermined system. \eqref{intro:underdetermined}. In our case, $y$ are the observed Fourier components, $x$ is the reconstructed image and $F$ is the Fourier Transform. We try to find $x$ that explain the observations $y$, but since it is an under determined system, there are multiple solutions. The intuitive way to solve it is to increase the number of observations until we have a fully-determined system. However, this is not necessary. With the theory of Compressive Sensing one can find the correct solution by exploiting the fact that $x$ is compressible.

It turns out that many natural signals are compressible. A picture taken by an ordinary camera produces megabytes of data, but after compression only a fraction of the original need to stored. JPEG2000 uses the Wavelet Transform and only needs to store a limited number of Wavelet coefficients. More formally, if $W$ is the Wavelet transform and $e$ a natural Image, $We = \alpha$. $\alpha$ are the wavelet coefficients. Since natural images are compressible in the wavelet domain, $\alpha$ is sparse (contains mostly zeroes) and can be stored using less space than the image $e$.

Coming back to the original underdetermined system \eqref{intro:underdetermined}, we introduce a Dictionary $D$ which contains our basis functions. We assume that $x$ is compressible using the Dictionary: $D\alpha = x$ and $\alpha$ has only a few non-zero entries. Instead of solving \eqref{intro:underdetermined} directly, we substitute $x$ with $D\alpha$ and search for the solution that has the fewest non-zero elements in $\alpha$. We arrive at the minimization problem \eqref{intro:ssparseland}, where $\mathit{ind}()$ is the indicator function. 

S- Compressible. Under what circumstance is $D\tilde{\alpha} = x$. In compressed Sensing states that if we have a "good" dictionary, i.e. one where $x$. Also there are few limitations on $D$. It can be the Wavelet transform, Fourier Transform, or even a combination of the two.

\begin{equation}\label{intro:ssparseland}
\tilde{\alpha} =  \underset{\alpha}{arg min} \: \mathit{ind}(D\alpha) \quad s. t. \quad FD\alpha = y
\end{equation}

Non-convex optimization, real environment has noise. It can be shown that the L1 norm approximates the indicator function.

\begin{equation}\label{intro:sparseland}
\begin{split}
x  =  D_{\alpha}
\end{split}
\quad , \quad
\begin{split}
x &\in \mathcal{R}^n\\
\alpha &\in \mathcal{R}^k\\
D &\in \mathcal{R}^{n \times k}
\end{split}
\quad with \quad
\begin{split}
n \ll k
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{cs:noiseless}
\tilde{\alpha} =  \underset{\alpha}{arg\: min}
\end{equation}
