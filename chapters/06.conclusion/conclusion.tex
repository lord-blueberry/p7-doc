\section{Conclusion and Future Development}
Flexible approach.

Flexibility allows multiple ways to solve the same problem. Optimal solution does not exist yet. 

Potential to reduce the needed parameters. Compressed Sensing by design has the $\lambda$ parameter. In practice, the parameter can be estimated.

Limited through CASA interface. and the chosen Optimization Algorithm

small Field of View. Self-cal application

Currently infeasible for large scale, new larger instruments.
