\subsection{The UV Plane}

From Antenna Configuration to UV-Coverage to Sampled-UV space

The baseline, the distance between two antennas. The bigger the distance the higher the frequency it can measure.

UV plane, how it looks and the earth rotation. Limitations, not in the center (because overlapping antennas), and not outside of earth.

Undersampled by design, results in a Dirty Image.
