\section*{Abstract}
Image reconstruction from under-sampled measurements is a problem existing in many fields like MRI scans and Radio Astronomy. Applying the Theory of compressed Sensing, one is able to reconstruct the observed image by including prior information. A proof of concept Compressed Sensing reconstruction algorithm was applied to radio astronomy and implemented in the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA). The Reconstruction was compared to the standard algorithm in Astronomy, CLEAN. It was shown that with compressed Sensing, we can change and modify the prior as we wish and change the prior as we make new discoveries about the universe.
