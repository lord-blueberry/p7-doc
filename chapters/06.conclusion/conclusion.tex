\section{Conclusion and Future Development}
Flexible approach.

Flexibility allows multiple ways to solve the same problem. Optimal solution does not exist yet. 

Limited through CASA interface. and the chosen Optimization Algorithm

small Field of View. Self-cal application

Currently infeasible for large scale, new larger instruments.
